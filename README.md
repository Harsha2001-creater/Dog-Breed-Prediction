<h1 align="center">Dog Breed Prediction Project 🐾🐶</h1>
Welcome to our Dog Breed Prediction Project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting dog breeds from images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we seek to contribute to conservation efforts by providing a reliable tool for identifying dog breeds and preserving genetic diversity within dog populations.  

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting dog breeds from images.

## 🚀 Why This Project

This project aims to address the need for accurate and efficient dog breed identification, which is essential for various applications such as pet adoption, veterinary care, and breed conservation.

## 📊 Dataset 
For this project, we utilized a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Stanford Dogs dataset. This dataset contains a vast collection of images encompassing 120 different breeds of dogs from around the world. With a size of approximately 20GB, the dataset provides a rich and diverse source of imagery for training and evaluating our machine learning models.
